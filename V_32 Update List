If space allows, add knight rider "kitt" animation to be activated when 0 RPM detected. Menu option to turn on/off, set color, speed, etc. 
Add "profiles" for settings (ie, normal driving, track, drifting, drag, etc)
in Debug mode, clean all other serial.print data so it's just RPM output in all instances 
Add more brightness resolution, or make existing scale more dramatic
Add a run-time "hour meter" option in the menu. Test to see if an RTC chip is needed.
